A safe and robust autonomous driving system relies on
accurate perception of the environment. To be more specific,
an autonomous vehicle needs to accurately detect cars,
pedestrians, cyclists, road signs, and other objects in realtime
in order to make the right control decisions that ensure
safety. Moreover, to be economical and widely deployable,
this object detector must operate on embedded processors
that dissipate far less power than powerful GPUs used for
benchmarking in typical computer vision experiments.
